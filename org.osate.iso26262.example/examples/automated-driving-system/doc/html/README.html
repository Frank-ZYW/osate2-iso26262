<p>This example reproduces the Automated Driving System described in the <em>AADL In Practice</em>. It was originally designed to demonstrate the following capabilities of <em>OSATE2 ISO-26262 plugin</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure Modes Effects and Diagnostic Coverage Analysis (FMEDA)</li>
<li>Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)</li>
<li>Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA)</li>

</ul>
<p>A complete description of the case-study is available in <a href='http://julien.gunnm.org/aadl-book'>AADL In Practice</a>.</p>
<p>This README is based on OSATE 2.11.0.</p>
<h3 id='organization-of-the-example'>Organization of the example</h3>
<p>The integration.aadl is the main AADL module.</p>
<h3 id='conducting-analysis'>Conducting analysis</h3>
<p>To analyze the model start by right clicking on one of the implementations in the Outline perspective and select &quot;Instantiate&quot;. The instantiation is placed in the instance folder within the model in the AADL Navigator. </p>
